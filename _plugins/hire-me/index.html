<p>
    I specialize in CakePHP-related work. Want to hire me? Read on to get a gist of what I do.
<p>
    <a href="http://github.com/josegonzalez/">My Github Profile</a>. I work on various CakePHP-related plugins and projects. I am an active contributor on several projects used throughout the community, such as the <a href="http://github.com/jrbasso/MeioUpload">MeioUpload project</a> and <a href="http://github.com/felixge/cakephp-authsome">Authsome plugin</a>. I also run <a href="http://cakepackages.com">Cake Packages</a>, an <a href="http://github.com/josegonzalez/cakepackages">open source</a> project that tracks CakePHP-related code.
</p>
<p>
    I specialize in API interaction, and hack on random things like the <a href="http://github.com/josegonzalez/twilio">Twilio API</a>, <a href="http://github.com/josegonzalez/trimmable-behavior">Url Shorteners</a>, and the <a href="http://github.com/josegonzalez/cakepackages">Github API</a>. I also love writing scraping code, and regularly write code to scrape data useful to me, like my <a href="http://github.com/josegonzalez/bankofamerica_task">Bank Of America</a> transactions.
</p>
<p>
    I've worked at Sun Microsystems on Project Management Tools as a research assistant, and have since worked on, as well as with, several open source projects related to project management tools. Some of my current projects, like my skeleton to <a href="http://github.com/josegonzalez/app_skellington">auto-generate an admin section based on the db config</a>, are based partially on my want/need to create a useful tool. I'm always interested in work related to project management.
</p>
<p>
    I work on projects on an hourly basis or project-basis - we decide this at the outset of any and all stages. Prices are contingent on the amount of work, deadlines, and my level of knowledge on the subject. Quotes are free, but be aware that they will be better estimated with better specification. I do not take Credit Cards, and Checks will be cashed before items are delivered. I follow a partial payment plan, usually in three steps, where I take a percentage up-front, around half when we are half-way through, and the rest before final delivery. I will not work for equity.
</p>
<p>
    I work remotely; If you are in NYC, I am up for meeting to finalize items in person, but will not be on the premises. I am available for contract work otherwise. I will be in communication in a regular fashion, and we can decide upon how the best method would be as time goes on.
</p>
<p>
    I work best with a DCVS such as GIT or Mercurial - Git is preferred, but any DCVS will do - except for SVK. I can work with SVN, and have accounts on both Github and Codaset, so adding me to your project will be easy. I am familiar with many online tools, such as Trac and CodeBaseHQ.
</p>
<p>
    All work is confidential if necessary. Your IP is your IP. I may use existing open-source code I am aware of in my work, depending upon the need and whether it is appropriate. It is also possible that I will use none, and this is wholly up to the requirements.
