I worked at SeatGeek as a contractor for about a year, both full and part-time as my schedule would allow. In that time, I've worked on integrating with partner APIs, internal background tasks and utilities, integrating the PHPUnit Testing Framework with our existing application, as well as the occasional HTML/CSS/JS task. For my work, SeatGeek has graciously given me a job offer I've accepted, as well as the title of "Git Guru".

As a result of my work at SeatGeek, I have also been able to contribute back to the community, not only through the development of [Open Source projects](https://github.com/seatgeek/) we've released after internal work, but also as a result of usage in my own work, such as [CakeDjjob](https://github.com/josegonzalez/cake_djjob).
