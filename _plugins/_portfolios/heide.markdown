Model Heide Lindgren gave me the opportunity to design and build a website to her exacting specifications. The entire site was built custom from the ground up, and supports posting via-email, posting various types of content, and has a custom lightbox implementation. The entire site was built in [Lithium](http://lithify.me/), a new PHP 5.3-only framework, with some help from the Zend libraries.

I've also been able to take my experience with Heide's custom content management system to built [CakeAdmin](https://github.com/josegonzalez/cake_admin), a content management system generator for the CakePHP framework. It supports many of the features I built programmatically for Heide's CMS, and will allow me to further improve upon this work for future clients quickly and easily.
