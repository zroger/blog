  description: Redesign of existing, bland website for Senior Design

I was contacted to revamp the existing Senior Design Site for the NCSU School of BME, and after carefully considering all facets of the content-laden site, came up with the following design. I've centralized all the links, providing access to more information via lightbox popups where necessary.

BME students were thrilled with the new design, as the old website was lacking in usability and ease of navigation. I went through multiple rounds of design with both students and researchers before settling on the current look, and all parties involved were quite pleased with the results.
