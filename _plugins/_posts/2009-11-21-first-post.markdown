Finally decided to get something back up in terms of a blog. Currently using Jekyll, as my own clone of Jekyll in PHP doesn't work quite as well as I want it to yet (I actually implemented it all as a CakePHP shell, but thats for another blog post).

I'll be delving into ruby a little, but I will also post guides and snippets of code for CakePHP developers to use and abuse. I should also have a lot of my old content up, and will hopefully be blogging more often (everyone says they will and never do), so these pages may be of some use in the future. Wish me luck.
