I just noticed that a lot of people have trouble filling out a readme, so I came up with one that can be used to fill-in the blanks. I added the MIT license at the bottom to make the license explicit, and I may update the entire license in the future, but you're free to use it as necessary.

Feel free to omit sections, but for the most part you'll want to fill this in as much as possible. Having a good readme is a great way to get people using and contributing to your open source project. Documentation is key, and since cakephp plugins are small enough, we can get away with good docblocks and an awesome readme :)

It's in textile, but feel free to convert it to markdown, rst, or whatever you prefer.
