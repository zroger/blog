The CakePHP documentation _sucks_. By sucks I mean dumbasses are unable to read/use/search it. Which translates into more support in IRC, more ass-kicking on my part, and more repetition. I would like a *DRY* IRC channel. Also, I assume people do not appreciate my smart-ass remarks.

So I'm rewriting the [CakePHP Bakery Documentation](http://bakery.cakephp.org) as a [set of tutorials on github](http://github.com/josegonzalez/documentation). I've been in contact with a few small publishers in the past year, and asked a few questions of an editor, and I realize that rather than trying to get a book published, I'll just offer the stuff for free. Fewer deadlines - actually, none as I don't give a rats ass if I finish - but it also means I can improve it or fix it as time goes on. If I choose to publish it later, and it is any good, I'll just go to a Book-on-Demand service or sell it on Amazon or similar.
