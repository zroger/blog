I've been hard at work lately on my new pet project, the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/dialog">Dialog API</a> module. My goal for this module is simple. Take the incredibly simple CTools ajax command framework, and merry it to the jQuery UI Dialog widget, to provide an incredibly simple api for creating dynamic dialogs. The basis of this module comes from CTools' modal framework (which I wrote about <a href="/node/31">previously</a>), so if you've used that in the past, using dialog should be a breeze.

Though this project is less than 2 months old, it is starting to gain some traction. <a href="http://drupal.org/user/53892">Dave Reid</a> just committed support for Dialog to both the 6.x and 7.x branches of <a href="http://drupal.org/project/xmlsitemap">XML Sitemap</a>. There is also <a href="http://drupal.org/node/690862">an issue in the Skinr queue</a> to use Dialog in place of modalframe.
