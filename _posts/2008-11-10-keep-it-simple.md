<p><img src="http://rdlopez.com/sites/all/themes/custom/keepitsimple/images/screenshot.png" class="float-left"  />I'm always on the lookout for a high-quality html/css template.  I found <a href="http://styleshout.com">StyleShout.com</a> after reading <a href="http://walkah.net/blog/walkah/vectorlover-drupal-theme">Walkah's post</a> about building a Drupal theme out of the VectorLover template.  That's where I found <a href="http://www.styleshout.com/templates/preview/KeepItSimple1-0/index.html">KeepItSimple</a>, a simple, clean and full-featured template.</p>

I've taken Walkah's cue and turned this template into a Drupal 6 theme.  I liked the results so much, I've decided to use it here on my own blog.  I'll be cleaning it up and releasing it here.  Sorry Drupal.org, this template is not GPL so it won't make it into contrib.  Maybe I can talk the author into a dual-license.
