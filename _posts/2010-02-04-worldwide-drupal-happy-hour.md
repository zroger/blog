<p>Since April of last year, I've been organizing the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/taxonomy/term/6036">Drupal NYC Happy Hour</a>.&nbsp; The idea is very simple, and one that I admittedly got from the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/twin-cities">Twin Citites group</a>.&nbsp; Get a bunch of drupalers together to have a few drinks, with no other agenda.&nbsp; This simple concept has proven to be wildly popular, and we regularly see crowds of around 50 drupalers.</p>
<p>Earlier today, in the #drupalnyc IRC room, kombucha suggested that having a regularly recurring date for our local Happy Hour may catch on in other groups.&nbsp; How cool would it be to have a <strong><em>Worldwide Drupal Happy Hour</em></strong> on the same day every month?</p>
<p>Does your local Drupal group host a similar event?&nbsp; If so, would you consider changing the date if we could agree on a standard date?</p>
