While in DC for <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/">Drupalcon</a>, the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sonydslra100/">Sony &alpha;100</a> digital <abbr title="Single Lens Reflex">SLR</abbr> that I ordered last week arrived.  I got an incredible deal on it through the Sony Family Center store, yay perks!  

Here are the first few shots I took with it.  I must say I'm impressed.  Truth be told, I've never used an SLR before, so I was a thought my lack of knowledge would cause some pretty crummy pictures.  Yet to my surprise, it was pretty dang easy to take some nice pictures.  I look forward to learning more about photography and how to get the best out of the pictures that I am taking.
