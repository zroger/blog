Since April of last year, I've been organizing the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/taxonomy/term/6036">Drupal NYC Happy Hour</a>.  The idea is very simple, and one that I admittedly got from the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/twin-cities">Twin Citites group</a>.  Get a bunch of drupalers together to have a few drinks, with no other agenda.  This simple concept has proven to be wildly popular, and we regularly see crowds of around 50 drupalers.

Earlier today, in the #drupalnyc IRC room, kombucha suggested that having a regularly recurring date for our local Happy Hour may catch on in other groups.  How cool would it be to have a __Worldwide Drupal Happy Hour__ on the same day every month?

Does your local Drupal group host a similar event?  If so, would you consider changing the date if we could agree on a standard date?
