I've been using this little tip for so long now that I forgot how to do it, until I showed someone here at work how to do it.  You can use the standard console application that ships with OS X to view any type of log file.  Its not obvious how to do this since there is no interface to add a new log file, but once you figure it out, it couldn't be any easier.

1. Open up a terminal.
2. cd ~/Library/Logs
3. ln -s /Applications/MAMP/logs MAMP
4. Open console.app and you will now see MAMP in the ~/Library/Logs tree
