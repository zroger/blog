<p>While discussing the news about <a href="http://whitehouse.gov">Whitehouse.gov</a> moving to Drupal at work today, I had an idea to create a bookmarklet to help me figure out whether the site I am browsing is indeed a Drupal site or not.  Then at lunch, <a href="http://shalosophy.com/">Shawn </a>(<a href="http://twitter.com/shalosophy">@shalosophy</a>) had a great idea that this should be made into a firefox extension.  And so was born the "Is it Drupal?" Firefox Extension.</p><p>The extension simply puts a Drupal icon in your status bar which is gray when on a site that is thought to not be powered by Drupal, and turns blue when a Drupal site is detected.  This is my first foray into Firefox extension building so be kind.</p><p>And here it is for all to enjoy.</p><h3>Install the <a title="Install the &quot;Is it Drupal?&quot; Firefox extension" href="/files/isitdrupal.xpi">"Is it Drupal?"</a> Firefox Extension<br /></h3>
